For my round 1 submission, I have created 2 separate projects.

## Project 1: This project lives in this repository. The repository primarily contains a website, but the project will go beyond just a website.

I have created a spoof service that advertises landing students their dream jobs for a small, exclusive cohort of students. The project consists of a website, email, and Google Form. The website will be used, in tandem with the email (see photo in repo), to attract students to fill out their contact info on the Google Form, as many Harvard students want to land a prestigious career.

After students fill out their names, emails, and phone numbers, I will send out an email to everyone who applied saying they have been accepted into the cohort. They will then be directed to a cohort welcome party, expecting to meet a small group of students. However, since everyone who applied gets the acceptance email, they will be in for a surprise when they meet at the designated location and are in attendance of an event that serves no real purpose with a large group of random other students.

Another idea instead of a welcome party is an exclusive cohort-only career fair with top companies, promising networking opportunities. There would be the same acceptance of all applicants, but instead of meeting top companies, they would go to a career fair with only local Harvard Square businesses. Data collected from these students can also be used by the Lampoon in the future for other ideas.

## Project 2: This project is in a different repository, linked below.

This is a spoof of a MCS questionnaire designed to poke fun at some of the common jobs that Harvard students recruit for and, sometimes, idolize.
