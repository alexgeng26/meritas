This website will be used, in tandem with the email (see photo in repo), to attract students to fill out their contact info on the Google Form.

After students fill out their names, emails, and phone numbers, I will send out an email to everyone who applied that they have been accepted into the cohort. They will then be directed to a cohort welcome party, expecting to meet a small, exclusive group of students. However, since everyone who applied gets the acceptance email, they will be in for a surprise when they meet at the designated location and are in attendance of an event that serves no real purpose with a large group of random other students. Data collected from these students can then be used by the Lampoon in the future for future ideas.
